# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This repository contains code and resources for the Titanic Machine Learning project. The goal is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset from Kaggle. It consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`.
training dataset contains information about a subset of the passengers, including whether they survived or not. The test dataset contains similar information but lacks the 'Survived' column, which will be predicted by our machine learning model

## Workflow Steps

- Data Preprocessing: The first step is to clean and prepare the data. We handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and convert categorical variables into numerical format.

- Feature Selection: We analyze the importance of features and select relevant ones for training the machine learning model.

- Model Selection: We explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks and select the most appropriate one based on evaluation metrics.

- Model Training: With the selected algorithm, we train the model on the preprocessed data using cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting.

- Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps us assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- Predictions: After training and tuning, the model is ready to make predictions on new data (the test dataset).
